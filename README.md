# AI
* Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
 Artificial intelligence(AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on
 the information they collect. It miics the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. AI is much more about the process and the
 capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-
 functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and 
 contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset.
  
  AI Perspectives: acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally:
  Acting Humanly: 
  There is a turing test performed to show the perspective of acting humanly. In this test, Human interrogates entity via teletype for 5 minutes. If, after
  5 minutes, human cannot tell whether entity is human or machine, then the entity must be counted as intelligent.
  
  Thinking Humanly:
  Thinking humanly means trying to understand and model how the human mind works. There are (at least) two possible routes that humans use to find the
  answer to a question: i) We reason about it to find the answer. This is called “introspection”. ii) We conduct experiments to find the answer, drawing
  upon scientific techniques to conduct controlled experiments and measure change. The field of Cognitive Science mainly focuses on modeling how people
  think.
  
  Thinking Rationally:
  It is the process trying to understand how people actually think. It uses symbolic logic to capture the laws of rational thought as symbols that can be
  manipulated. It involves manipulating the symbols according to well-defined rules, kind of like algebra. The result is an idealized model of human
  reasoning. This approach is attractive to theoretists, modeling how humans should think and reason in an ideal world.
  
  Acting Rationally:
  Acting rationally means acting to achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs or understanding about the world. An agent is a system that perceives an
  environment and acts within that environment. An intelligent agent is one that acts rationally with respect to its goals. For example, an agent that is
  designed to play a game should make moves that increase its chances of winning the game.
  
  
  History of AI
  It was first introduced in 1956. John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference. 
  Then in 1969, Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.
  In 1997, Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create
  this large computer.
  In 2002, The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 
  In between 2005 to 2019, speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their
  debut.
  2020 and present, Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of
  the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other
  methods. 
  
  
  Foundations of AI:
  Philosophy: 
  It takes multiple tasks from philosophy. 
  Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusion?
  Aristotle (312 – 322 B.C ) was the first to formulate the precise set of laws governing the rational parts of the mind. He developed an informal system
  of syllogisms for proper reasoning, which in principle allowed one to generate conclusions mechanically given initial premises.
  
  How does the mind arises from a physical brain?
  It is one thing to say that mind operates, at least in part, according to logical rules and to build physical system that emulates some of those rules,
  but it's another thing to say that mind itself is such a physical system.
  
  Where does knowledge from?
  Given a physical mind that manipulate knowledge, the next problem is to establish the source of knowledge.
  
  How does knowledge lead to action?
  Philosophy tries to answer the connection between knowledge and action. This question is vital to AI because intelligence requires action as well as
  reasoning.
  
  Mathematics:
  Philosophers staked out some of the fundamental ideals of AI, but the leap to formal science required a level of mathematical formalization in their
  fundamental areas:
  What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
  What can be compute?
  How do we reason with uncertain information?
  
  
  Economics:
  AI takes the following ideas from economics.
  
  How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff (utility)?
  Decision theory, which combines probability theory. With utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decision made under uncertainty.
  This is suitable for large “economics” where each agent need pay no attention to the action of the other gent as individuals.
  
  How should we do this when others may not go along?
  For small economics, the situation is much more like a game. The action of one player can significantly affect the utility of another. Unlike decision
  theory game theory does not offer an unambiguous prescription for selecting actions.
  
  How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
  For the most part economist did not address this question. This topic was pursed in the field of operation research (OR).
  
  
  Psychology:
  Psychology tries to answer the following question:
  How do humans and animals think and act? Modern science proves that computer models could be used to address the psychology of memory, language and
  logical thinking respectively. It is now common view among psychologist that "a cognitive theory should be like a computer program."
  Computer engineering:
  
  How can we build an efficient computer?
  For AI to succeed, we need two things:
  Intelligence and artifact.
  The computer has been the artifact of the choice.
  Control theory and cybernetics.
  
  How can artifacts operate under their own control?
  Control theory and cybernetics deals with the self controlling machine. Modern control theory has its goal to design the system that maximize an
  objective function overtime. This roughly match the AI view: designing system that behave optimally.
  
  
  Linguistics:
  Language is directly related to thought. Modern linguistics and AI, were born at about the same time and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid
  field called computational linguistics or natural language processing.
