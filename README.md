* Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  Artificial intelligence(AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the           information they collect. It miics the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. AI is much more about the process and the capability for     superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning, human-like robots         taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very           valuable business asset.
