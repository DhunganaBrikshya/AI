# AI
* Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
 Artificial intelligence(AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on
 the information they collect. It miics the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. AI is much more about the process and the
 capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-
 functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and 
 contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset.
  
  AI Perspectives: acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally:
  Acting Humanly: 
  There is a turing test performed to show the perspective of acting humanly. In this test, Human interrogates entity via teletype for 5 minutes. If, after
  5 minutes, human cannot tell whether entity is human or machine, then the entity must be counted as intelligent.
  
  Thinking Humanly:
  Thinking humanly means trying to understand and model how the human mind works. There are (at least) two possible routes that humans use to find the
  answer to a question: i) We reason about it to find the answer. This is called “introspection”. ii) We conduct experiments to find the answer, drawing
  upon scientific techniques to conduct controlled experiments and measure change. The field of Cognitive Science mainly focuses on modeling how people
  think.
  
  Thinking Rationally:
  It is the process trying to understand how people actually think. It uses symbolic logic to capture the laws of rational thought as symbols that can be
  manipulated. It involves manipulating the symbols according to well-defined rules, kind of like algebra. The result is an idealized model of human
  reasoning. This approach is attractive to theoretists, modeling how humans should think and reason in an ideal world.
  
  Acting Rationally:
  Acting rationally means acting to achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs or understanding about the world. An agent is a system that perceives an
  environment and acts within that environment. An intelligent agent is one that acts rationally with respect to its goals. For example, an agent that is
  designed to play a game should make moves that increase its chances of winning the game.
